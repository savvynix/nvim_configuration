# nvim_configuration

This is my first Github Repo. I wanted to have my configuration offsite. Feel free to use it

make sure you have unzip installed for Linux
It uses packer.nvim, and mason.nvim for LSP Support 
you will need to have installed npm for language support.

Special Thanks to the youtube user Typecraft for his instructional videos.

this config is my own flare. more will be added in the future.
